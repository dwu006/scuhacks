# Plant Portal 🌱

An innovative platform empowering users to build virtual gardens that reflect their real-life planting efforts, fostering environmental awareness and community-driven sustainability.
Part of Hack for Humanity 2025.

## Project Overview 

### Inspiration
As climate change accelerates, taking action, no matter how small, can make a difference. Inspired by the nostalgic virtual pet games of the early 2000s and the modern need for sustainability, Plant Portal transforms gardening into an interactive and educational experience. This platform encourages users to cultivate real-world greenery while tracking their efforts in a virtual garden, reinforcing the impact of small, collective environmental actions.

### What it does 
Plant Portal bridges the gap between digital engagement and environmental responsibility by allowing users to:
 - Create a Virtual Garden by uploading images of real plants to generate a corresponding digital garden.
 - Identify and Learn using AI-powered plant recognition that provides details on the species and its environmental impact.
 - Track Carbon Reduction by seeing how each plant contributes to carbon absorption and sustainability efforts.
 - Connect with the Community by sharing your garden with others, inspire sustainable habits, and exchange gardening tips.
 - Encourage Eco-Friendly Actions by gamifying sustainability by rewarding users for planting, caring, and growing their digital and physical gardens.


### Technical Stack
