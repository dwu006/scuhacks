            Plants play a crucial role in reducing carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere. Through photosynthesis, 
            they convert CO2 into oxygen and store carbon in their tissues. Each plant in your garden contributes 
            to this vital process, helping combat climate change one leaf at a time.

            these differences can help you maximize your garden&apos;s positive environmental impact.
